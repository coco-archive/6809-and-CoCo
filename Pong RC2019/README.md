# Pong
**Initial Version for the 03/2019 Retro Challenge**

In the 2018 RetroChallenge, I worked on a CoCo version of Foo Raceway, a game I had fond memories of from my early days with the Ohio Scientific (OSI) C1P and C4P-MF back in the early 1980s. Another game I particularly rememeber is a version of Pong that was typed in from a magazine.

As things develop, details can be found in my blog at:
