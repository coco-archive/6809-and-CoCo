# Foo Raceway
**Initial Version for the 2018 Retro Challenge**

Foo Raceway was a game I orignally created (with some help from others) on the Ohio Scientific (OSI) C4P MF back in 1982 or 1983. This version for the Color Computer was created as part of the 2018 Retro Challenge.

While the core code is written in BASIC, it makes use of two machine language subroutines which are POKEd into memory from a series of DATA statements.

Details can be found in my blog at:
